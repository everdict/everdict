# Desktop app — full web parity + resident self-hosted runner

> **Status: decisions D1–D5 LOCKED with the user (2026-07-03) — implementation in progress.**
> Supersedes the "tray-only companion" idea: the user requirement is **perform identically to the web via
> the desktop app too** — the desktop must do *everything the web does*, plus what only a native app can do (resident
> runner, one-click pairing, tray/notifications/autostart).
> Dev conventions for `apps/desktop` / `packages/runner-core` live in skill `.claude/skills/desktop/`.
> - **D6 — auto-update: detect/download automatic, APPLY is user-consented (LOCKED); feed location PENDING.**
>   `electron-updater` in main behind `UpdaterController` (DI): check on launch + every 6h,
>   `autoDownload`, `autoInstallOnAppQuit`; "Apply" only via the tray restart item — never force-restart
>   a runner mid-job (apply = graceful runner shutdown → `quitAndInstall`). Activation gate:
>   `app.isPackaged` && (packaged `app-update.yml` [lands when a `publish` config is added] ||
>   `EVERDICT_UPDATE_FEED_URL` env → generic feed via a userData config injected through
>   `autoUpdater.updateConfigPath` — `setFeedURL` alone is insufficient: AppImageUpdater reads the
>   on-disk config during download). **The feed's public location is the user's pending decision**:
>   (a) public `everdict-releases` repo (code stays private; needs a cross-repo PAT secret in CI) vs
>   (b) make `Ho2eny/everdict` public (current CI works as-is). Until then the updater is cleanly
>   disabled. mac auto-update stays inert until code signing exists; deb installs don't auto-update
>   (AppImage/NSIS/mac-zip do).
> - **D7 — the desktop fully absorbs the pairing surface (LOCKED 2026-07-03).** The browser web no longer
>   offers manual device pairing (the token-shown-once modal is removed): personal-machine pairing is the
>   desktop's one-click only, and the browser account page becomes **manage-only** (list · live status ·
>   revoke) + a "Get the desktop app" CTA (`DESKTOP_DOWNLOAD_URL`). The server surface is unchanged —
>   `POST /runners` (BFF+MCP `pair_runner`) stays, which is also the **headless path**: on a server/CI box,
>   create the pairing with an API key (`curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ak_…" -X POST /runners`) and feed
>   the returned `rnr_` token to `everdict runner --pair`.
> - **D8 — the packaged app must know its server (LOCKED 2026-07-03).** Web URL resolution:
>   `EVERDICT_WEB_URL` env (dev/e2e) > `config.json webUrl` (user-saved) > CI-baked default
>   (`EVERDICT_DESKTOP_DEFAULT_WEB_URL` repo Variable → esbuild `define` at package time). None → a local
>   **first-run setup screen** (`assets/setup.html`) asks for the server address; also reachable from the
>   tray ("Change server address…"). The setup window gets its own 2-method bridge (`window.everdictSetup`:
>   get/setServerUrl) behind a `--everdict-setup` argv flag, and the main-side IPC only accepts calls whose
>   `senderFrame` is exactly the local setup.html `file://` URL. Changing the server rebuilds the app
>   window (old preload origin args are stale) and the runner bridge origin-guard reads the *current*
>   origin (getter, not a captured value). **Login/auth status**: with D8 in place the auth story is
>   closed — Keycloak OIDC runs inside the webview (D5, cookies persist like a browser), the runner
>   authenticates independently via its `rnr_` keychain token, and an account-switch mismatch shows a
>   re-pair callout on the account page. Live-verified end-to-end vs real Keycloak
>   (`scripts/live/desktop-keycloak.mjs`): fresh machine → setup screen → server saved → OIDC login
>   (alice) → one-click pair → runner online, against the real-auth control plane.
>
> - **D1 — the UI is the deployed web, not a rebuild.** The desktop shell renders the SaaS web
>   (`apps/web`) at its deployed URL inside the app window — the Linear/Slack/Notion model. `apps/web`
>   stays the **single UI SSOT**; the desktop has feature parity *by construction* (every web deploy
>   lands in the desktop instantly, no app release). We never fork or re-implement screens in the shell.
> - **D2 — shell is Electron (LOCKED).** Rationale: the monorepo is all-TS and the runner
>   core needs Node (`@everdict/agent`'s `runAgentJob`), which Electron's main process runs **in-process** —
>   no sidecar binary; bundled Chromium renders the Next 16 / Tailwind v4 app identically on every OS;
>   tray / auto-update / deep-link / keychain (`safeStorage`) are mature. The Tauri alternative is
>   smaller (~10MB vs ~100MB) but needs a Node sidecar for the runner, adds a Rust toolchain to a
>   TS-only repo, and renders through per-OS webviews (WebKitGTK/WebKit/WebView2 variance against a
>   complex Tailwind v4 app). For a resident dev tool, size is the cheaper sacrifice.
> - **D3 — the runner rides along, paired one-click from the logged-in session.** The desktop's native
>   payload is the [self-hosted runner](./self-hosted-runner.md): the runner loop (extracted to
>   `packages/runner-core`) runs in the Electron main process. Pairing needs **zero token copy-paste**:
>   the account page, when it detects the desktop bridge, offers "Connect this device as a runner" → the web (already
>   authenticated as the user) calls the existing pair API → hands the `rnr_` token to the bridge → main
>   process stores it in the OS keychain and starts the runner. Ownership stays personal (self-hosted-runner
>   D1) — the desktop just removes the friction.
> - **D4 — the bridge is minimal and origin-gated.** One preload API (`window.everdictDesktop`) with a
>   handful of IPC methods; `contextIsolation: true`, `nodeIntegration: false`; the preload is attached
>   **only** for the configured web origin. The renderer is the *remote web app* — it must never get
>   ambient Node/Electron power.
> - **D5 — auth stays exactly the web's; the desktop holds no access token.** Keycloak login happens in
>   the webview via Auth.js, the access token lives where it does in a browser — the **web origin's
>   server-side httpOnly cookie session** (the web is a BFF token courier, `docs/web.md`). The only
>   secret the desktop itself persists is the `rnr_` pairing token (keychain via `safeStorage`).
>   Outbound OAuth (connected accounts) also works unchanged: `authorizeUrl` → provider → 302 back to
>   `/<ws>/account` — all inside the webview, same as a browser tab.

Like [self-hosted-runner](./self-hosted-runner.md): **strict generalization, not a clean break.** The web,
the control plane, the MCP runner protocol (`lease_job`/`submit_job_result`/`heartbeat_job`), and the
`everdict runner` CLI are all untouched; the desktop is additive. The CLI remains the headless/CI answer.

## Problem

Two gaps, one product answer:

1. **Runner UX friction.** `everdict runner` lives in `apps/cli`, so a member must clone + `pnpm` build the
   monorepo, copy a shown-once `rnr_` token from the account page into `--pair <rnr_…> --api-url <url>`,
   and keep a terminal open forever (Ctrl-C kills it). The persona — "workspace member, not an everdict
   developer" — is exactly who this excludes.
2. **The requirement is web parity, not a companion.** A tray-only runner app would leave members
   juggling two surfaces (browser for evals, tray for the runner). The requirement: one desktop app that
   does **everything the web does** — dashboard, runs, harnesses, datasets, scorecards, judges, runtimes,
   settings, account — *and* hosts the runner.

The trap to avoid: re-implementing the UI in the desktop. `apps/web` is ~all of the product surface and
ships continuously; a second UI would fork every screen and rot immediately. D1 dissolves the parity
requirement structurally: parity is not a feature to build, it's a property of rendering the same app.

## Current state — verified

- **Web = BFF token courier** (`docs/web.md`) — Next.js 16 App Router; Auth.js keeps the Keycloak access
  token in a server-only httpOnly cookie; `control-plane.ts` forwards `Bearer` to `@everdict/api`; identity
  from `GET /me`. Pure HTTP client, **no `@everdict/*` deps**. Nothing about it assumes a browser tab — a
  webview holding the same cookies behaves identically.
- **Runner loop is already transport-clean** — `apps/cli/src/runner-loop.ts` (`runLeaseWorkers`, N lease
  workers over one MCP session) + `runner-session.ts` (`ResilientMcpSession` — reconnect-on-stale-session)
  + `run-leased-job.ts`, driving `runAgentJob` (`@everdict/agent`). It depends on flags + a token, not on
  being a CLI — extraction to a package is mechanical.
- **Pairing is a personal API** — `rnr_` token minted from the account page (BFF + MCP parity,
  self-hosted-runner slice 1), SHA-256-hashed at rest, owner = `principal.subject`, no role gate. A
  desktop bridge can drive the *same* endpoint from the logged-in web session.
- **Presence** — the web derives online/offline from `lastSeenAt` freshness; a desktop-resident runner
  long-polling `lease_job` keeps it green without the user thinking about it.

### `packages/runner-core` — one runner, three consumers

Move `runner-loop.ts` / `runner-session.ts` / `run-leased-job.ts` (+ their tests) from `apps/cli` into
`packages/runner-core` (depends on `@everdict/agent`, `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`; sits at the same layer as
`apps/*` consumers of `agent`). Exports: `runLeaseWorkers(opts)`, `ResilientMcpSession`, `mcpConnect`,
plus a small `RunnerHost` facade (start/stop/status events) for GUI embedding. `apps/cli` re-imports and
behaves identically (pure refactor slice); `apps/desktop` main process embeds `RunnerHost`. (A future CI
runner would be the third consumer.)

### The bridge (`window.everdictDesktop`) — smallest possible surface

Preload-exposed, only when `new URL(window.location).origin === configuredWebOrigin`:

- `pairRunner({ token, apiUrl, label }): Promise<void>` — web hands the freshly-minted `rnr_` token down;
  main stores it (keychain) and starts the runner. The token crosses the bridge once, is never persisted
  by the web, and never comes *back* up.
- `runnerStatus(): Promise<{ state: "off"|"idle"|"running"; runnerId?, label?, capabilities?, activeJobs? }>`
  + a `subscribe` event for live updates — lets the account page's connected-runners roster show *this device*
  truthfully instead of `lastSeenAt` guessing.
- `unpairRunner(): Promise<void>` — stop + forget keychain entry (web still calls the revoke API — the
  authority stays server-side).
- `appInfo(): { version, platform }` — for the account page to render "this device" affordances at all.

That's the whole API. No generic `invoke`, no fs/shell access, nothing else.

### One-click pairing flow (D3)

1. Member opens the desktop app → logs into Keycloak in the webview (first run only; cookies persist).
2. Account page (`/<ws>/account`) sees `window.everdictDesktop` → the connected-runners section shows
   **"Connect this device as a runner"** (prefilled label = hostname from `appInfo`).
3. Click → web calls the **existing** pair endpoint (BFF, user session) → gets the shown-once `rnr_`
   token → `everdictDesktop.pairRunner({ token, apiUrl, label })` → main stores in keychain, starts
   `RunnerHost`, long-poll begins → presence dot goes green.
4. Web-side change is one small desktop-aware branch in the existing account/runner feature — no new
   endpoints, no new auth path.

### Runner lifecycle in the desktop

- **Start/stop** — auto-start the runner on app launch when paired (toggle in tray + account page);
  tray shows `idle / running (n) / off`.
- **Capabilities** — same detection as the CLI (docker present → `service` harnesses allowed;
  auto-advertise per self-hosted-service-runner); surfaced as a status row, not a log-line banner.
- **OS notifications** — job/scorecard completion notifies locally (the local analog of the Mattermost
  notify path); click → deep-link the window to the run/scorecard page.
- **Autostart** — OS login item (Electron `setLoginItemSettings`), so "a runner that's up at boot" holds.
- **Updates** — electron-updater for the shell; **UI updates need no desktop release** (D1 payoff — the
  web deploys, the desktop just renders it).

### Reuse vs new

| Piece | Status |
|---|---|
| Entire UI (`apps/web` deployed) — all screens, auth, role-gating | **reused verbatim** — the whole point (D1) |
| Runner protocol (MCP `lease_job`/`submit_job_result`/`heartbeat_job`) + pairing API | **reused, untouched** |
| Runner loop (`runLeaseWorkers`, `ResilientMcpSession`, `runAgentJob` path) | **extracted** → `packages/runner-core` (pure refactor) |
| `everdict runner` CLI | **kept** — thin wrapper over `runner-core`, headless/CI answer |
| `apps/desktop` (Electron shell: window, tray, keychain, autostart, updater, IPC) | **new** |
| `window.everdictDesktop` preload bridge + web desktop-aware pairing branch | **new** (bridge) + **small web edit** |
| Packaging/signing (linux AppImage/deb · mac dmg+notarize · win nsis) + download links on the account page | **new** |

## Slices (each lands green: format/lint/typecheck/test/build)

1. ✅ (`bbc7b58`) **`packages/runner-core` extraction** — move loop/session/leased-job + tests out of `apps/cli`;
   CLI re-imports; zero behavior change (CLI live e2e re-run proves it).
2. ✅ (`e2b903a`) **Shell** — `apps/desktop` Electron app: BrowserWindow on the deployed web URL, persistent session
   (Keycloak login sticks), navigation policy (top-level http/https allowed — OIDC/OAuth redirect flows
   must leave and re-enter the web origin; `window.open` to non-web origins → system browser), tray
   skeleton, autostart toggle. No runner yet — this alone already *is* "identical to the web".
   (electron-updater moves to slice 5 — it belongs with electron-builder packaging.)
3. ✅ **Bridge + one-click pairing** — preload `window.everdictDesktop` (origin-gated: preload arg-origin gate +
   main-side `senderFrame` check), `safeStorage` keychain token store, `RunnerHost` (runner-core facade:
   start/stop/status events over `runLeaseWorkers`) embedded via `RunnerController` (pair/unpair/restore-on-boot);
   web: desktop-aware "Connect this device as a runner" one-click (label=hostname, token never shown — bridge-only) +
   live "this device" status row (running(n)/online) replacing the `lastSeenAt` heuristic for this device.
4. ✅ **Runner surface polish** — tray status row + tooltip (not paired / online idle / running (n)) and
   tray-local unpair (token discard + stop; server-side revoke stays the web's authority); OS
   notification per **drain** (running→idle transition, success/failure aggregate — per-case notify would
   spam batches; click → focus window); web "this device" row prefers **live** capabilities from the
   bridge (+ "no docker → service harnesses unavailable" hint), so a docker daemon stopped after pairing
   shows immediately.
5. ✅ **Packaging + live e2e** — linux: esbuild single-file bundle (main ESM + preload CJS,
   `electron` external — avoids packing pnpm-symlinked `node_modules` into asar; `extraMetadata.main`
   swaps the entry only in the package) + electron-builder AppImage (`pnpm -F @everdict/desktop package`,
   NOT in turbo gates), packaged binary smoke-verified. **Download link**: `DESKTOP_DOWNLOAD_URL`
   (web env, optional) → Account > Connected runners shows an "Install the desktop app" link to browser users only
   (hidden inside the desktop). **Live e2e PASS** (`scripts/live/desktop-runner.mjs`, 2026-07-03):
   Playwright drives the real Electron shell (clean `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` = fresh machine) → account page
   one-click "Connect this device as a runner" → runner online with live "this device" row → run pinned to
   `self:<id>` executes on the desktop → `provenance{ranOn:self-hosted, runner, by}` verified.
   Keyring-less Linux needed one product fix: opt in to safeStorage `basic_text` with a logged warning
   (VSCode-style), else `isEncryptionAvailable()=false` blocks pairing.
6. ✅ **Release CI** (`.github/workflows/desktop-release.yml`) — tag `desktop-vX.Y.Z` (or manual
   dispatch → draft) fans out a 3-OS matrix (ubuntu/macos/windows runners): version injected from the
   tag, `turbo build --filter=@everdict/desktop` (dep chain only), esbuild bundle → electron-builder
   per-OS (`--linux` AppImage+deb · `--mac` dmg+zip×[x64,arm64] · `--win` nsis), then one job collects
   artifacts into a single **GitHub Release** (`softprops/action-gh-release`, auto release notes).
   Deterministic artifact names (`Everdict-<ver>-<os>-<arch>.<ext>`). All targets **unsigned** until certs
   exist (`CSC_IDENTITY_AUTO_DISCOVERY=false`); `latest*.yml` uploaded for a future electron-updater.
   Point the web's `DESKTOP_DOWNLOAD_URL` at `https://github.com/Ho2eny/everdict/releases/latest`.
   **Remaining**: signing certs (mac notarize / win Authenticode) — config hooks noted in
   `electron-builder.yml`.
7. ✅ **Download page** (D7 follow-up — repo stays private, no public releases repo) —
   `/{workspace}/download`: the web **server** reads the latest `desktop-v*` release from GitHub with a
   server-only PAT (`DESKTOP_RELEASES_REPO`/`DESKTOP_RELEASES_TOKEN`, 5-min cached, `features/download-desktop`),
   renders OS-detected recommended buttons (UA → linux/mac/win; mac shows arm64+x64 — arch is not UA-reliable)
   + an all-platforms list + post-install steps + unsigned caveats. Actual downloads go through
   `GET /api/desktop/download?id=…`: session-checked (`currentPrincipal`), asset id validated against **our**
   desktop release only, then GitHub's octet-stream 302 → **signed temporary URL** is passed to the browser
   (big files never stream through the web server). The Runners tab CTA links here (internal) instead of an
   external URL; `DESKTOP_DOWNLOAD_URL` remains as the page's fallback when no token is configured.
   Live-verified: page renders v0.1.0 assets from the private repo; valid id → 302 to
   `release-assets.githubusercontent.com`; foreign id → 404.
8. ✅ **Auto-update client** (D6) — `UpdaterController` (`updater.ts`, DI + vitest) + tray UX
   (`Downloading update… (n%)` disabled row → `Apply vX update (restart)` action) + ready OS
   notification; apply = graceful runner shutdown → `quitAndInstall(false, true)` with the
   before-quit preventDefault path flagged off. **Live-verified** (2026-07-03, packaged AppImage vs
   local generic feed): idle → checking → found 0.2.0 → downloading (126MB fresh) → sha512 verify →
   ready. Finding: `setFeedURL` alone breaks at download (AppImageUpdater reads on-disk config) —
   env activation writes `userData/app-update.yml` and injects it via `updateConfigPath`.
   **Open**: flip the feed on — user decision (a) public `everdict-releases` + CI PAT vs (b) repo
   public; then add the `publish` block to `electron-builder.yml` (nothing else changes).

## Decisions / non-goals

- **No UI re-implementation in the shell — ever.** If a screen needs desktop awareness, it's a
  `window.everdictDesktop`-conditional branch in `apps/web`, not a desktop-side screen.
- **No offline/local control plane.** The desktop is online like the web; the control plane stays remote.
  (A run *executes* locally via the runner — that part already works offline-ish by nature of pull.)
- **CLI stays first-class.** Headless boxes, CI, and servers keep `everdict runner`; the desktop is the
  human-machine answer, not a replacement.
- **Renderer gets no Node.** `contextIsolation` on, `nodeIntegration` off, bridge origin-gated —
  the remote web app must never gain local power beyond the four bridge methods.
- **Electron vs Tauri** — D2 locked Electron (all-TS, in-process runner, rendering consistency);
  revisit Tauri only if footprint becomes a real complaint, since D1/D3/D4/D5 are shell-agnostic.
