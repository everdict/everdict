# Service-topology harnesses

A harness can be a process (Claude Code) or a **deployed multi-service topology that acts on a target env**
(browser/OS). See `docs/service-harness.md`.

## The model
- `HarnessSpec(kind:"service")`: `services[]` + `dependencies[]` (shared stores) + `target` (browser+ext) +
  `frontDoor` + `traceSource`.
- A run = ensure warm topology → per-case browser → drive (front-door `POST /runs` with per-run wiring) →
  collect trace (OTel/MLflow) → observe (browser snapshot) → grade.

## Efficiency (the whole point)
stateless services = per-version warm; stores = shared + per-case logical isolation
(`thread_id`/key-prefix/object-prefix); browser = per-case. Wiring via the front-door, not a redeploy.

## Orchestrator-agnostic
`ServiceTopologyBackend` (a `Backend`) holds a `TopologyRuntime`. Only the runtime differs:
`buildNomadTopologyJob` (Nomad) vs `buildK8sManifests` (K8s). Both pure + deterministic-tested.

## Live Nomad runtime
`NomadTopologyRuntime` implements `TopologyRuntime` against the Nomad API: `ensureTopology` registers the
warm service job, polls each group to running, and discovers endpoints from the alloc via pure `resolvePort`
(`AllocatedResources.Shared.Ports` → `Resources.Networks`); `provisionBrowserEnv` runs a per-case headless
Chromium and discovers its CDP from `/json/version`. Services with a `port` get a group dynamic-port (no Consul).
**Tenant isolation:** `ensureTopology`/`provisionBrowserEnv` take an optional `TrustZone`; the warm pool is keyed
by `(spec, version, zone.id)` and the job ID/namespace carry the zone — warm topologies are **never shared across
tenants** (a shared agent/LangGraph process would leak state/secrets). Verified live on Nomad.

## Live K8s runtime
`K8sTopologyRuntime` is the same shape via an injectable `Kubectl` (default shells to `kubectl`):
`ensureNamespace` (per-tenant namespace = isolation) → `apply` Deployment+Service → `rollout status` → endpoint
via `kubectl port-forward svc/… :<port>` (parse the local port from stdout). `provisionBrowserEnv` runs a
headless-Chromium Deployment+Service; `dispose()` deletes only the browser (warm topology survives), `teardown()`
deletes the namespace. `imagePullPolicy`/`runtimeClass` are options (kind: pre-`kind load` images + IfNotPresent).
Verified live on kind — Nomad↔K8s parity.

## Front-door generalization — making driving harness-agnostic (in progress)
`ServiceTopologyBackend.dispatch` was hardcoded to one protocol (browser-use-langgraph): fixed payload,
fire-and-forget submit, trace-by-Assay-runId, always-provisioned browser, fixed image. The direction — a declarative
`FrontDoorProtocol` + a thin `FrontDoorDriver` (the harness-agnostic sibling of `TopologyRuntime`), each hardcode →
an optional knob defaulting to today — is in `docs/architecture/front-door-generalization.md`. Read it before
touching `service-backend.ts`'s driving logic.
- **#2 completion — DONE.** `FrontDoorDriver`/`HttpFrontDoorDriver` (`front-door-driver.ts`) own submit + await;
  `frontDoor.completion` (`sync` default | `poll` with a `StatusMatch` done/failed matcher) in `@assay/core`;
  dispatch fails a run on completion timeout. `poll` = "hold until an async N-step agent finishes."
- **#3 correlate — DONE.** `frontDoor.correlate` (`injected` default = Assay runId | `returned` = extract the
  agent's own id from the submit response via `correlate.path` dot-path, used for both trace fetch and the poll
  `statusPath`). `SubmitFn` now returns the response body. Distinct from the still-dormant `frontDoor.trace` endpoint.
- Next: #1 payload template · #4 target strategy · #5 per-service image pin.

## Reference impls
`packages/topology/src/{nomad-topology,nomad-runtime,k8s-topology,k8s-runtime,kubectl,service-backend,environment-manager}.ts`,
`packages/trace/src/{otel,mlflow,trace-source}.ts`. Live now: both NomadTopologyRuntime + K8sTopologyRuntime apply
+ per-case CDP browser (`scripts/live/service-topology-{nomad,k8s}.mjs`). Still Phase 2: real browser+extension
(headful+xvfb+`--load-extension`) & browser-use images, real OTel/MLflow span ingestion.
