# Assay

Harness-agnostic, infra-agnostic **agent evaluation runtime**. Register & version any agent harness —
a CLI (Claude Code, Codex) or a multi-service topology (browser-use LangGraph) — run it across
environments (repo / browser / os-use) and orchestrators (Nomad / K8s / local), and **score** it
fairly, repeatably, with regression tracking. Eval-first; just enough operational runtime to drive
long, stateful, isolated runs. **Fully self-hosted** — no vendor sandbox; isolation comes from your own
Nomad/K8s (gVisor/Kata).

## The spine
A run separates four in-sandbox concerns + a placement layer:
**Harness** (under test) · **Environment** (the world it acts on) · **Driver** (in-sandbox compute) ·
**Grader** (how we judge) · **Backend** (where it's placed: Nomad / K8s / local).

## Architecture (one-way deps)
```
core ← { drivers · environments · harnesses · graders · trace } ← runner ← agent ← backends ← { orchestrator · topology } ← apps/cli
```

## Packages
| Package | Role |
|---|---|
| `@assay/core` | contracts (interfaces + Zod + errors). Dependency root. |
| `@assay/drivers` | in-sandbox compute (`LocalDriver`). |
| `@assay/environments` | the world a run acts on (`RepoEnvironment`). |
| `@assay/harnesses` | the agent under test (`ClaudeCodeHarness`, `ScriptedHarness`) + stream-json→trace. |
| `@assay/graders` | scoring (tests-pass / cost / steps / latency). |
| `@assay/runner` | the eval loop (`runCase`). |
| `@assay/agent` | the dispatched unit (model B): runs `runCase` in an isolated job. |
| `@assay/backends` | placement: `Backend` (Local, Nomad) + `Router` / `BackendRegistry`. |
| `@assay/orchestrator` | durable control plane on Temporal (Direct / Temporal + worker). |
| `@assay/trace` | pull a harness trace from OTel/MLflow → `TraceEvent`. |
| `@assay/topology` | service-topology harnesses (multi-service + target env), Nomad/K8s. |
| `apps/cli` | control plane: `assay run`, `assay worker`. |

## Two kinds of harness
- **Process harness** (Claude Code, Codex): one binary run in a sandbox.
- **Service-topology harness** (browser-use-langgraph): a deployed topology (agent / MCP / action-stream
  + Postgres/Redis/MinIO) that acts on a target env (browser + extension). Efficient: warm per-version
  services + shared ID-keyed stores + per-case browser. See `docs/service-harness.md`.

## Run
```bash
pnpm install && pnpm build
# local — uses THIS machine's claude subscription (no API key):
pnpm assay run --task "Create ok.txt with the text done" --test "grep -q done ok.txt"
# distributed (Nomad) and/or durable (Temporal): see docs/execution-backends.md + docs/orchestration.md
```

## Develop
```bash
pnpm format && pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test && pnpm build
```

## Docs
- `docs/architecture/overview.md` — the architecture map
- `docs/service-harness.md` — multi-service topologies (Nomad/K8s, OTel/MLflow trace)
- `docs/execution-backends.md` — Backend vs Driver, multi-cluster routing
- `docs/orchestration.md` — Temporal durable control plane
- `docs/sandbox-auth.md` — how `claude` authenticates across backends
- `docs/migration/` — DB migration discipline
- conventions: `CLAUDE.md` + `.claude/` (reinterpreted from `digo-api` / `digo-infra-dev`)

## Status
Local end-to-end works live (real Claude Code via subscription). Distributed backends (Nomad/K8s),
Temporal orchestration, and service-topology harnesses are built + unit-tested; live runs need your
infra (cluster / Temporal server / harness images). Permissive-licensed, self-hosted stack only.
